# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

- The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there was any bias for Amazon Vine reviews versus non-vine reviews for Sports Products. Amazon Vine is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products.

## Results

-  
- 
- There are 334 Vine reviews and 61,614 non-Vine reviews for sports products.
- There were 139 5-Star Vine reviews and 32665 5-Star non-Vine reviews for sports products.
- 41.2% of Vine reviews were 5-stars, and 53.0% of non-Vine reviews were 5-stars for sports products.

## Summary

- There does not seem to be any positivity bias for the Vine reviews of sports products because the percentage of 5-star Vine reviews were lower than the percentage of 5-star reviews for non-Vine reviews. It also is supported by the larger amount of review data for non-Vine reviews and the percentage being over 50% for those reviews. Another analysis we could do is on the verified purchase column and see if the percentages would fluctuate for Vine and non-Vine reviews.
